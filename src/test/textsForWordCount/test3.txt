Ann:        Look, Harry1! That policeman’s waving to you. He wants you to stop.
Policeman:       Where do you think you are? On a race track2?
You must have been driving at seventy miles an hour.
Harry:            I can’t have been.
Policeman:      I was doing eighty when I overtook3 you.
Policeman:       Didn’t you see the speed limit?
Harry:            I’m afraid I didn’t, officer. I must have been dreaming .
Ann:        He wasn’t dreaming, officer. I was telling him to drive slowly.
Harry:            That’s why I didn’t see the sign.
Policeman:       Let me see your driving-license and your insurance certificate4.
Policeman:      I won’t charge you this time. But you’d better not do it again!
Harry:            Thank you. I’ll certainly be more careful.
Ann:        I told you to drive slowly, Harry.
Harry:            You always tell me to drive slowly, darling.


Ann:        Well, next time you’d better take my advice!
